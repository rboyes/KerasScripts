Some simple scripts to train a Keras model using ResNet50.

Use DirectoryTrainer.py to train a model with folders of training images and validation images.

Use DirectoryTester.py to test a model with a folder of unseen images.

Use Logloss.py to calculate the log loss between output from DirectoryTester.py and a known solution.

Use Ensemble.py to create an ensemble from several outputs of DirectoryTester.py.
